You have an idea. You're building the product. headless.ly gives you a running business from line one -- CRM, projects, billing, analytics, content, support -- all connected in one typed graph.

```typescript
import { Contact } from '@headlessly/crm'
import { Issue } from '@headlessly/projects'
import { Integration } from '@headlessly/platform'

// Connect your foundations immediately
await Integration.connect({ provider: 'stripe', apiKey: process.env.STRIPE_KEY })
await Integration.connect({ provider: 'github', token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN })

// Start building
await Contact.create({ name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@vc.com', stage: 'Lead' })
await Issue.create({ title: 'Build MVP', project: 'project_e5JhLzXc', status: 'InProgress' })
```

## The Build Phase

During build, you're focused on:

- **Projects** -- Issue, Project, Comment (syncing with GitHub Issues)
- **Content** -- Content, Asset, Site (docs, blog, landing pages)
- **CRM** -- Contact, Company (tracking investors, beta users, partners)

All 32 entities are available, but these are what matter most when you're building.
