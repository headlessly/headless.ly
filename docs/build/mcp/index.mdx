headless.ly exposes three MCP tools -- not hundreds. Any AI agent (Claude, GPT, custom) can operate the entire business through these three primitives.

```json title="headless.ly/mcp#search"
{ "type": "Contact", "filter": { "stage": "Lead", "createdAt": { "$gte": "today" } } }
```

```json title="headless.ly/mcp#fetch"
{ "type": "Contact", "id": "contact_uLoSfycy", "include": ["deals", "company"] }
```

```ts title="headless.ly/mcp#do"
const leads = await $.Contact.find({ stage: 'Lead' })
for (const lead of leads) {
  await $.Contact.qualify(lead.$id)
  await $.Deal.create({ contact: lead.$id, value: 50000, stage: 'Negotiation' })
}
```

## Why Three Tools?

Most MCP servers expose dozens or hundreds of tools. Agents struggle with large tool sets -- they don't know what to pick, they make mistakes, they waste tokens reasoning about options.

headless.ly gives agents three verbs that cover everything:

- **search** -- find entities across the graph with filters, sorting, and pagination
- **fetch** -- get a specific entity, schema, metric, or the full business status
- **do** -- execute arbitrary TypeScript in a secure sandbox with full access to every entity

The `do` tool is the universal interface. It runs arbitrary TypeScript in a secure sandbox powered by Cloudflare containers and `ai-evaluate`. The sandbox has access to `$` -- the universal context with all 32 entities. Any logic that goes beyond a simple lookup belongs in `do`.

## Connect Your Agent

Point any MCP-compatible client at your tenant's MCP endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "headlessly": {
      "url": "https://crm.headless.ly/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer hly_sk_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

The subdomain determines the default context. `crm.headless.ly/mcp` scopes to CRM entities, but `search`, `fetch`, and `do` can reach any entity in the graph regardless of subdomain.
