A Campaign is a coordinated marketing push -- a Product Hunt launch, a drip sequence, a content blitz. headless.ly treats campaigns as first-class entities with typed statuses, audience targeting via Segments, and full verb conjugation so agents can orchestrate every phase.

```typescript
import { Campaign, Segment } from '@headlessly/marketing'

const segment = await Segment.create({
  name: 'Early Adopters',
  as: 'Technical Founders',
  at: 'seed-stage startups',
  are: 'building AI products',
  using: 'LLM APIs and vector databases',
  to: 'ship faster without hiring',
})

const campaign = await Campaign.create({
  name: 'Product Hunt Launch',
  type: 'Event',
  status: 'Draft',
  segment: segment.$id,
  startDate: '2025-03-15T09:00:00Z',
})

await Campaign.launch({ id: campaign.$id })
```

## Create a Campaign

Every campaign starts as a Draft. Provide a name, a type, and optionally link it to a Segment for targeting:

```typescript
import { Campaign } from '@headlessly/marketing'

const campaign = await Campaign.create({
  name: 'Developer Newsletter #1',
  type: 'Email',
  status: 'Draft',
  startDate: '2025-04-01T08:00:00Z',
  endDate: '2025-04-01T12:00:00Z',
})
```

Campaign types map to distribution channels:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `Email` | Drip sequences, newsletters, announcements |
| `Social` | Twitter/X threads, LinkedIn posts |
| `Content` | Blog series, documentation pushes |
| `Paid` | Ad campaigns across platforms |
| `Event` | Product Hunt launches, webinars, conferences |

## Target a Segment

Link a campaign to a Segment to define who sees it:

```typescript
import { Campaign, Segment } from '@headlessly/marketing'

const segment = await Segment.create({
  name: 'AI Builders',
  filters: { source: 'github', stage: 'Lead' },
})

await Campaign.update({
  id: 'campaign_fX9bL5nRd',
  segment: segment.$id,
})
```

## Verb Conjugation

Campaigns have three custom verbs -- `launch`, `pause`, and `complete` -- each with the full lifecycle:

```typescript
import { Campaign } from '@headlessly/marketing'

// Execute
await Campaign.launch({ id: 'campaign_fX9bL5nRd' })
await Campaign.pause({ id: 'campaign_fX9bL5nRd' })
await Campaign.complete({ id: 'campaign_fX9bL5nRd' })

// BEFORE hooks
Campaign.launching(campaign => {
  console.log(`About to launch: ${campaign.name}`)
})

// AFTER hooks
Campaign.launched(campaign => {
  console.log(`Campaign live: ${campaign.name}`)
})
```

## Track Campaign Performance

React to campaign events to wire up attribution and analytics:

```typescript
import { Campaign } from '@headlessly/marketing'
import { Event } from '@headlessly/analytics'

Campaign.launched((campaign) => {
  Event.track({
    name: 'campaign_launched',
    properties: { campaign: campaign.$id, type: campaign.type },
  })
})

Campaign.completed((campaign) => {
  Event.track({
    name: 'campaign_completed',
    properties: { campaign: campaign.$id },
  })
})
```

## MCP

Search for active campaigns or launch one via MCP tools:

```json title="headless.ly/mcp#search"
{ "type": "Campaign", "filter": { "status": "Active" } }
```

```json title="headless.ly/mcp#fetch"
{ "type": "Campaign", "id": "campaign_fX9bL5nRd", "include": ["segment"] }
```

```ts title="headless.ly/mcp#do"
await $.Campaign.launch({ id: 'campaign_fX9bL5nRd' })
```

## CLI

```bash
npx @headlessly/cli Campaign.create --name "Launch Day" --type Event --status Draft
npx @headlessly/cli do Campaign.launch campaign_fX9bL5nRd
npx @headlessly/cli Campaign.find --status Active
```
