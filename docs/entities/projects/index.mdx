description: Project, Issue, Comment -- GitHub-backed issue tracking and work management as a typed graph.

Three entities form a connected graph for tracking work -- from high-level projects down to individual issues and threaded discussion. Projects contain issues, issues contain comments, and every mutation syncs bidirectionally with GitHub.

```typescript
import { Project, Issue, Comment } from '@headlessly/projects'

const project = await Project.create({
  name: 'Launch v2',
  slug: 'launch-v2',
  status: 'Active',
  visibility: 'Private',
})

const issue = await Issue.create({
  title: 'Implement webhook handler',
  project: project.$id,
  type: 'Feature',
  priority: 'High',
  status: 'Open',
})

await Issue.assign(issue.$id, { assignee: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd' })

await Comment.create({
  body: 'Started on the webhook handler -- PR incoming.',
  author: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd',
  issue: issue.$id,
})

await Issue.close(issue.$id)
await Project.complete(project.$id)
```

## The Work Graph

```
Organization ──< Project ──< Issue ──< Comment
                    │           │
                    │           ├── assignee ──> Contact
                    │           └── reporter ──> Contact
                    └── owner ──> Contact
```

Every arrow is a typed relationship defined in the Noun schema. Back-references are automatic -- `Project.issues` is the inverse of `Issue.project`.

## Entities

| Entity | Description | Custom Verbs |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Project](/entities/projects/project) | Container for organized work with status and visibility | `archive`, `complete`, `activate` |
| [Issue](/entities/projects/issue) | Unit of work -- bugs, features, tasks, epics | `assign`, `close`, `reopen` |
| [Comment](/entities/projects/comment) | Threaded discussion on issues | `resolve` |

## Cross-Domain Connections

Projects integrates with the rest of the business graph:

```typescript
import { Organization } from '@headlessly/crm'

Organization.created((org, $) => {
  $.Project.create({
    name: `${org.name} Onboarding`,
    organization: org.$id,
    status: 'Active',
  })
})
```

- **CRM**: Organizations map to projects for delivery tracking. Contacts serve as owners, assignees, and reporters.
- **Support**: Tickets can reference issues for bug tracking. Resolved issues trigger ticket updates.
- **Analytics**: Every verb emits events that feed into Metric and Goal tracking.
- **Content**: Documentation projects track content creation workflows.

## Package

```bash
npm install @headlessly/projects
```

```typescript
import { Project, Issue, Comment } from '@headlessly/projects'
```

Or via the unified SDK:

```typescript
import { $ } from '@headlessly/sdk'

await $.Project.find({ status: 'Active' })
await $.Issue.find({ priority: 'Urgent', status: 'Open' })
```
