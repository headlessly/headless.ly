title: Identity
description: User and ApiKey -- authentication, authorization, and programmatic access.
---

The Identity domain manages who can access your headless.ly tenant and how. It contains two entities:

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [User](/entities/identity/user) | Authenticated humans -- founders, team members, collaborators |
| [ApiKey](/entities/identity/api-key) | Programmatic access tokens for SDK, CI/CD, and agent authentication |

Identity is backed by WorkOS via [oauth.do](https://oauth.do). Users authenticate through SSO, magic links, or social login. ApiKeys enable machine-to-machine access with scoped permissions.

Organization -- the tenant itself -- lives in the [CRM](/entities/crm) domain. Identity answers "who are you?" while CRM answers "what org do you belong to?"

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { User, ApiKey } from '@headlessly/sdk'

// Invite a team member
await User.create({ name: 'Alice Chen', email: 'alice@acme.co', role: 'Admin' })

// Create an API key for CI/CD
await ApiKey.create({ name: 'GitHub Actions', scopes: 'read:all,write:content' })
```

## Progressive Identity (id.org.ai)

headless.ly uses progressive identity -- agents connect first, authenticate later:

1. **L0 (Anonymous)** -- read-only sandbox, no auth required
2. **L1 (Session)** -- write access with ephemeral session
3. **L2 (Claimed)** -- persistent identity via GitHub commit
4. **L3 (Production)** -- billing attached, full access

See [id.org.ai](https://id.org.ai) for the open identity standard.
