description: Campaign, Segment, Form — growth and acquisition with ICP targeting.
---

Acquire users, run campaigns, segment audiences. Segment includes the ICP sentence pattern from the startup-builder — define your ideal customer as a natural sentence.

## Campaign

Marketing initiatives — launches, drips, content pushes.

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'digital-objects'

export const Campaign = Noun('Campaign', {
  name: 'string!',
  type: 'Email | Social | Content | Paid | Event',
  status: 'Draft | Active | Paused | Completed',
  segment: '-> Segment?',
  startDate: 'datetime?',
  endDate: 'datetime?',
  launch:   'Launched',
  pause:    'Paused',
  complete: 'Completed',
})
```

| Verb | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `launch` | `Launched` | Start the campaign |
| `pause` | `Paused` | Temporarily stop |
| `complete` | `Completed` | Mark as finished |

## Segment

Audience groups with ICP sentence pattern. Define your ideal customer profile as a natural sentence: *"\{as\} at \{at\} are \{are\} using \{using\} to \{to\}"*.

```typescript
export const Segment = Noun('Segment', {
  name: 'string!',
  as: 'string?',
  at: 'string?',
  are: 'string?',
  using: 'string?',
  to: 'string?',
  filters: 'json?',
  size: 'number?',
  refresh: 'Refreshed',
  archive: 'Archived',
})
```

### ICP Sentence Pattern

The `as/at/are/using/to` fields compose into a natural ICP sentence:

```
"Compliance Officers at healthcare companies are managing audits using spreadsheets and email to stay compliant"
```

| Field | Maps To | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `as` | Occupation | "Compliance Officers" |
| `at` | Industry | "healthcare companies" |
| `are` | Process | "managing audits" |
| `using` | Tool/Tech | "spreadsheets and email" |
| `to` | Goal | "stay compliant" |

Fields fuzzy-match against ontology data (NAICS industries, O*NET occupations, APQC processes) for structured segmentation.

## Form

Data collection — sign-up, waitlist, contact us.

```typescript
export const Form = Noun('Form', {
  name: 'string!',
  fields: 'json!',
  segment: '-> Segment?',
  status: 'Draft | Active | Archived',
  submissions: 'number?',
  publish: 'Published',
  archive: 'Archived',
})
```
