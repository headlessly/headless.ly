One entity handles the entire customer support lifecycle -- from initial request through resolution, escalation, and satisfaction tracking. Tickets connect to CRM contacts, organizations, and deals for full account context.

```typescript
import { Ticket } from '@headlessly/support'

const ticket = await Ticket.create({
  subject: 'Cannot access billing portal',
  description: 'Getting a 403 error when clicking the billing link.',
  priority: 'High',
  channel: 'Email',
  requester: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd',
  organization: 'org_Nw8rTxJv',
})

await Ticket.resolve(ticket.$id)
```

## Entities

| Entity | Description | Custom Verbs |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Ticket](/entities/support/ticket) | Support requests with priority, channel, and satisfaction tracking | `resolve`, `escalate`, `close`, `reopen` |

## Cross-Domain Connections

Support connects to the full business graph:

```typescript
import { Ticket } from '@headlessly/support'

Ticket.created((ticket, $) => {
  $.Activity.create({
    subject: `Support: ${ticket.subject}`,
    type: 'Task',
    contact: ticket.requester,
  })
})

Ticket.escalated((ticket, $) => {
  $.Issue.create({
    title: `Escalation: ${ticket.subject}`,
    type: 'Bug',
    priority: ticket.priority,
  })
})
```

- **CRM**: Tickets reference Contacts as requesters and assignees. Organizations provide account-level context. Deals link support to active sales.
- **Projects**: Escalated tickets create Issues for engineering follow-up.
- **Analytics**: Ticket events feed into Metrics -- first response time, resolution time, CSAT scores.
- **Billing**: Ticket context includes subscription status for priority routing.

## Package

```bash
npm install @headlessly/support
```

```typescript
import { Ticket } from '@headlessly/support'
```

Or via the unified SDK:

```typescript
import { $ } from '@headlessly/sdk'

await $.Ticket.find({ status: 'Open', priority: 'Urgent' })
await $.Ticket.resolve('ticket_nV4xKpQm')
```
