Answer questions, resolve bugs, track customer issues. Knowledge base articles are now [Content](/docs/entities/content) with `type: 'Article'`. Replies are now [Messages](/docs/entities/communication) — cross-channel communication that works everywhere.

## Ticket

Support requests — bugs, questions, feature requests.

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'digital-objects'

export const Ticket = Noun('Ticket', {
  subject: 'string!',
  body: 'text!',
  status: 'Open | Waiting | Resolved | Closed',
  priority: 'Urgent | High | Medium | Low',
  contact: '-> Contact.tickets',
  assignee: '-> User?',
  comments: '<- Comment.ticket[]',
  messages: '<- Message.ticket[]',
  assign:   'Assigned',
  resolve:  'Resolved',
  close:    'Closed',
  reopen:   'Reopened',
  escalate: 'Escalated',
})
```

| Verb | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `assign` | `Assigned` | Assign to a team member |
| `resolve` | `Resolved` | Mark as resolved |

### What moved

- **Reply** → `Message` with `ticket` relationship. Replies are Messages that arrive on any channel (email, Slack, web chat, SMS).
