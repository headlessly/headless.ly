title: Error Codes
description: HTTP error codes, response format, and troubleshooting guide.
---

All error responses share a consistent JSON format. The `error` field contains a machine-readable code, `message` provides a human-readable explanation, and additional fields vary by error type.

## Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "No Contact with ID 'contact_xYzAbCdE' exists.",
  "type": "Contact",
  "id": "contact_xYzAbCdE"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `error` | string | Machine-readable error code |
| `message` | string | Human-readable explanation |
| `type` | string | Entity type involved (when applicable) |
| `id` | string | Entity ID involved (when applicable) |
| `field` | string | Field that caused the error (for validation errors) |
| `details` | object[] | Array of sub-errors (for batch and validation) |

## Error Codes

### 400 Bad Request

The request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_filter",
  "message": "Unknown operator '$like' in filter for field 'name'. Supported: $eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $in, $nin, $exists, $regex, $not.",
  "field": "name"
}
```

Common causes: invalid JSON body, unknown filter operator, invalid sort field, `limit` exceeding 100, malformed entity ID format.

### 401 Unauthorized

Missing or invalid authentication credentials.

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Missing or invalid Authorization header. Provide a valid API key: Bearer hly_sk_..."
}
```

Ensure the `Authorization` header is set to `Bearer hly_sk_your_key`. API keys are available at `https://headless.ly/~{tenant}/settings/api-keys`.

### 403 Forbidden

The authenticated key does not have permission for this operation.

```json
{
  "error": "forbidden",
  "message": "API key does not have write access. Upgrade to L2+ at /settings/api-keys."
}
```

Common causes: L0/L1 key attempting a write operation, cross-tenant access without admin privileges.

### 404 Not Found

The requested entity, type, or tenant does not exist.

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "No Deal with ID 'deal_xYzAbCdE' exists.",
  "type": "Deal",
  "id": "deal_xYzAbCdE"
}
```

### 409 Conflict

The operation conflicts with the current state — typically a duplicate unique field.

```json
{
  "error": "conflict",
  "message": "A Contact with email 'alice@startup.io' already exists.",
  "field": "email",
  "existingId": "contact_fX9bL5nRd"
}
```

### 422 Unprocessable Entity

The request body is valid JSON but fails schema validation.

```json
{
  "error": "validation_error",
  "message": "Validation failed for Contact.",
  "details": [
    { "field": "name", "message": "Required field 'name' is missing." },
    { "field": "stage", "message": "Invalid value 'Unknown'. Expected: Lead, Qualified, Customer, Churned, Partner." }
  ]
}
```

### 429 Rate Limited

Too many requests. The response includes headers to guide retry behavior.

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limited",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 12 seconds."
}
```

Headers included:

```
Retry-After: 12
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706745612
```

### 500 Internal Server Error

An unexpected error on the server side.

```json
{
  "error": "internal_error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred. Request ID: req_aBcDeFgH."
}
```

Include the `requestId` when contacting support.

### 502 Bad Gateway

An upstream service (Stripe, GitHub, or a Durable Object) is unreachable.

```json
{
  "error": "bad_gateway",
  "message": "Upstream service 'stripe' is not responding. Retry in a few seconds."
}
```

### 503 Service Unavailable

The service is temporarily unavailable, usually during deployment or maintenance.

```json
{
  "error": "service_unavailable",
  "message": "Service is temporarily unavailable. Retry after 5 seconds."
}
```

Always includes a `Retry-After` header.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| All requests return 401 | Verify `Authorization: Bearer hly_sk_...` header is present |
| Writes return 403 | Confirm your API key is L2+ (check `/settings/api-keys`) |
| Filter returns 400 | Ensure the filter JSON is valid and operators are supported |
| Entity not found after create | Check you are querying the same tenant (`/~{tenant}/`) |
| 429 during bulk operations | Use the [Batch API](/docs/reference/rest/batch) instead of individual requests |
