title: Dashboards
description: Your entire business at a glance — for agents via $.status(), for humans via Numerics, Grafana, or any BI tool.

headless.ly is headless — no built-in UI dashboards. But one system means one connection shows your entire business.

## For Agents

The agent's dashboard is `$.status()`:

```typescript
import { $ } from '@headlessly/sdk'

const state = await $.status()
// {
//   revenue:    { mrr: 12_500, churn: 2.1, nrr: 108 },
//   pipeline:   { leads: 47, qualified: 12, deals_open: 8 },
//   product:    { tasks_open: 23, blocked: 2 },
//   support:    { tickets_open: 5, p0: 1, avg_response: '2h' },
//   marketing:  { campaigns_active: 3, signups_7d: 89 },
//   engagement: { dau: 230, mau: 1_200 },
//   alerts:     [...]
// }
```

The agent doesn't look at a chart. It reasons about the data and acts.

## For Humans

The same data, piped to any visualization tool:

### Numerics

iOS/Mac widgets for real-time business KPIs. One connection to the metrics API.

### Grafana

Time-series dashboards over the Iceberg R2 lakehouse. Full historical data.

### Retool / Appsmith

Custom internal tools against the REST API.

### Google Sheets

Live connection or CSV/JSON export.

### Any BI Tool

Standard REST + OpenAPI means any tool can connect.

## Metrics API

```
GET /~my-startup/metrics
```

Returns every dimension:

```json
{
  "revenue":    { "mrr": 12500, "arr": 150000, "churn": 2.1, "nrr": 108 },
  "pipeline":   { "leads": 47, "qualified": 12, "deals_open": 8, "deal_value": 340000 },
  "product":    { "issues_open": 23, "issues_closed_7d": 15 },
  "support":    { "tickets_open": 5, "avg_response": "2h", "csat": 94 },
  "marketing":  { "campaigns_active": 3, "signups_7d": 89, "conversion": 4.2 },
  "engagement": { "dau": 230, "mau": 1200, "events_24h": 15400 }
}
```

One API. Every metric. Complete business view.
