GitHub is the truth source for all Projects entities from day 1.

## Connect

```typescript
import { Integration } from '@headlessly/platform'

await Integration.connect({ provider: 'github', token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN })
```

## Entity Mapping

| headless.ly | GitHub | Direction |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Project | Repos / Projects | Bidirectional |
| Issue | Issues / PRs | Bidirectional |
| Comment | Issue comments | Bidirectional |

Creating an Issue in headless.ly creates a GitHub issue. Closing a GitHub issue completes the Issue.

## Webhook Events

| GitHub Event | headless.ly Event |
|-------------|------------------|
| `issues.opened` | `Issue.Created` |
| `issues.closed` | `Issue.Completed` |
| `issues.assigned` | `Issue.Assigned` |
| `pull_request.merged` | `Issue.Completed` |
| `issue_comment.created` | `Comment.Created` |

## Issue Status Mapping

| GitHub | headless.ly |
|--------|-------------|
| Open issue | `Todo` or `InProgress` |
| Closed issue | `Done` |
| Open PR | `InProgress` |
| Merged PR | `Done` |

React to events with handlers:

```typescript
import { Issue, Comment } from '@headlessly/projects'

Issue.completed((issue, $) => {
  $.Event.create({ type: 'issue_closed', project: issue.project })
})

Comment.created((comment, $) => {
  $.Event.create({ type: 'comment_added', issue: comment.issue })
})
```
