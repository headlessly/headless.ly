Every entity exists because headless.ly needs it to run itself as an autonomous business.

## Base Meta-Fields

Every Digital Object carries these `$` meta-fields automatically — you never declare them in a Noun, but they're always present:

```typescript
{
  $type: 'Contact',                              // TypeScript discriminator
  $id: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd',                     // unique, type-prefixed
  $context: 'https://headless.ly/~acme',         // tenant namespace
  $version: 7,                                   // event-sourcing version
  $createdAt: '2025-01-15T...',
  $createdBy: 'user_Qm8xNfKpL',
  $updatedAt: '2025-02-07T...',
}
```

`$context` supports custom domains — if Acme maps `api.acme.com` to their org, then `https://headless.ly/~acme` and `https://api.acme.com` resolve to the same data.
