## Conjugation Pattern

Every verb in the system follows the same four-part conjugation:

```
verb
  ├── verb()        → execute (imperative)
  ├── verbing()     → BEFORE hook (present participle)
  ├── verbed()      → AFTER hook (past tense)
  └── verbedBy      → audit trail (passive voice)
```

```typescript
import { Contact } from '@headlessly/crm'

// Execute the verb
await Contact.qualify({ id: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd' })

// BEFORE hook — runs before execution
Contact.qualifying(contact => {
  if (!contact.email) throw new Error('Cannot qualify without email')
  return contact
})

// AFTER hook — runs after execution
Contact.qualified((contact, $) => {
  $.Issue.create({
    type: 'Task',
    subject: `Follow up with ${contact.name}`,
    contact: contact.$id,
  })
})

// Audit — queryable reverse lookup
const events = await Contact.qualifiedBy('agent_mR4nVkTw')
```

## Default CRUD Verbs

Every Noun receives three CRUD verbs automatically. No declaration needed.

| Verb | Participle | Past Tense | Audit | Event |
|------|-----------|------------|-------|-------|
| `create` | `creating` | `created` | `createdBy` | `Entity.Created` |
| `update` | `updating` | `updated` | `updatedBy` | `Entity.Updated` |
| `delete` | `deleting` | `deleted` | `deletedBy` | `Entity.Deleted` |

```typescript
import { Contact } from '@headlessly/crm'

// Full CRUD conjugation — available on every entity
Contact.creating(contact => { /* validate before create */ })
const created = await Contact.create({ name: 'Alice', stage: 'Lead' })
Contact.created(contact => { /* react after create */ })

Contact.updating((contact, changes) => { /* validate before update */ })
await Contact.update('contact_fX9bL5nRd', { stage: 'Qualified' })
Contact.updated(contact => { /* react after update */ })

Contact.deleting(contact => { /* guard before delete */ })
await Contact.delete('contact_fX9bL5nRd')
Contact.deleted(contact => { /* clean up after delete */ })
```

To remove a CRUD verb, set it to `null` in the Noun definition. See [Digital Objects](/docs/reference/concepts/digital-objects) for details.

## Custom Verb Declaration

Custom verbs are declared as properties on the Noun definition. The key is the verb infinitive; the value is the PascalCase past-tense event name:

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'digital-objects'

export const Deal = Noun('Deal', {
  name: 'string!',
  value: 'number!',
  stage: 'Discovery | Proposal | Negotiation | Closed | Lost',
  contact: '-> Contact.deals',

  advance: 'Advanced',
  close:   'Closed',
  lose:    'Lost',
  reopen:  'Reopened',
})
```

Each declaration generates the full conjugation:

| Declaration | Execute | Before | After | Audit |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| `advance: 'Advanced'` | `Deal.advance()` | `Deal.advancing()` | `Deal.advanced()` | `Deal.advancedBy` |
| `close: 'Closed'` | `Deal.close()` | `Deal.closing()` | `Deal.closed()` | `Deal.closedBy` |
| `lose: 'Lost'` | `Deal.lose()` | `Deal.losing()` | `Deal.lost()` | `Deal.lostBy` |
| `reopen: 'Reopened'` | `Deal.reopen()` | `Deal.reopening()` | `Deal.reopened()` | `Deal.reopenedBy` |

## BEFORE Hooks (Validation)

BEFORE hooks run synchronously before the verb executes. They receive the entity (or creation payload) and can:

- **Validate** — throw to reject the operation
- **Transform** — return a modified entity to change what gets written
- **Enrich** — attach computed properties before persistence

```typescript
import { Contact } from '@headlessly/crm'
import { Subscription } from '@headlessly/billing'

// Reject invalid operations
Contact.qualifying(contact => {
  if (!contact.email) throw new Error('Cannot qualify without email')
  if (!contact.company) throw new Error('Contact must belong to a company')
  return contact
})

// Transform before write
Subscription.creating(sub => {
  return { ...sub, startDate: new Date().toISOString() }
})
```

If a BEFORE hook throws, the verb does not execute and no event is emitted. The error propagates to the caller.

## AFTER Hooks (Side Effects)

AFTER hooks run asynchronously after the verb succeeds and the event is written. They receive the entity and a `$` context for cross-domain operations:

```typescript
import { Deal } from '@headlessly/crm'

Deal.closed((deal, $) => {
  // Cross-domain: create a billing subscription
  $.Subscription.create({ plan: 'pro', contact: deal.contact })

  // Cross-domain: update the contact stage
  $.Contact.update(deal.contact, { stage: 'Customer' })

  // Cross-domain: create a support article
  $.Article.create({
    title: `Onboarding: ${deal.name}`,
    contact: deal.contact,
  })
})
```

The `$` argument provides access to all 35 entities across all domains. Import it from `@headlessly/sdk` when used outside a hook:

```typescript
import { $ } from '@headlessly/sdk'
```

## Verb Execution Across Interfaces

The same verb works identically across all five interfaces:

### SDK

```typescript
import { Contact } from '@headlessly/crm'

await Contact.qualify({ id: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd' })
```

### MCP

```ts title="headless.ly/mcp#do"
await $.Contact.qualify({ id: 'contact_fX9bL5nRd' })
```

### CLI

```bash
npx @headlessly/cli do Contact.qualify contact_fX9bL5nRd
```

### REST

```bash
POST https://crm.headless.ly/~my-startup/Contact/contact_fX9bL5nRd/qualify
```

### Events

```json title="headless.ly/mcp#search"
{ "type": "Event", "filter": { "type": "Contact.Qualified", "target": "contact_fX9bL5nRd" } }
```

All interfaces produce the same event, the same audit trail, and the same hook execution.

## Code-as-Data Execution

Verb handlers (BEFORE and AFTER hooks) are serialized via `fn.toString()` and stored in the tenant's Durable Object. They execute inside the DO -- no separate function infrastructure, no cold starts, no network hops.

```
Handler registered → fn.toString() → stored in DO SQLite
Verb executed      → handler deserialized → runs in-DO → ~0ms latency
```

This means handlers have access to the full entity graph within the DO but cannot make external network calls. For external integrations, use WebSocket or Webhook subscription modes instead. See [Events](/docs/reference/concepts/events) for subscription mode details.
