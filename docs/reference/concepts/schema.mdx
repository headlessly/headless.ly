## Meta-Type Foundation

At its core, Headless.ly uses a semantic type system built on four foundational types:

### Noun

Entity type definitions. Every entity in the system is a Noun.

```typescript
import { Noun } from 'digital-objects'

export const Contact = Noun('Contact', {
  name: 'string!',
  email: 'string?#',
  stage: 'Lead | Qualified | Customer | Churned | Partner',
  company: '-> Company.contacts',
  deals: '<- Deal.contact[]',
  qualify: 'Qualified',
})
```

### Verb

Action predicates that describe what can be done.

```typescript
Verb: {
  verb: 'create',
  activity: 'Creating',
  event: 'Created',
  inverse: 'delete',
  category: 'CRUD',
}
```

### Action

Semantic operations combining Subject + Verb + Object (GraphDL notation):

```typescript
Action: {
  name: 'Create Contact',
  subject: 'User',
  verb: 'create',
  object: 'Contact',
  enabled: true,
}
```

### Event

Past-tense outcomes that record what happened:

```typescript
Event: {
  type: 'ContactCreated',
  action: 'create-contact',
  actor: 'user_fX9bL5nRd',
  target: 'contact_jH6gT3mVa',
  timestamp: '2026-01-15T12:00:00Z',
}
```

## Schema Categories

The full schema spans these domains:

| Category | Entities | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Identity** | User, Organization, ApiKey | Authentication and tenancy |
| **CRM** | Contact, Company, Deal | Customer relationship management |
| **Projects** | Project, Issue, Comment | Project and task management |
| **Content** | Content, Asset, Site | Content management |
| **Billing** | Customer, Product, Price, Subscription, Invoice, Payment | Billing and subscriptions |
| **Support** | Ticket | Customer support |
| **Analytics** | Event, Metric, Funnel, Goal | Observability and metrics |
| **Marketing** | Campaign, Segment, Form | Marketing automation |
| **Experimentation** | Experiment, FeatureFlag | A/B testing and feature flags |
| **Platform** | Workflow, Integration, Agent | Platform infrastructure |

## Field Notation

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `'string!'` | Required string | `name: 'string!'` |
| `'string?'` | Optional string | `phone: 'string?'` |
| `'string?#'` | Optional, indexed | `email: 'string?#'` |
| `'-> Type.field'` | Belongs-to relationship | `company: '-> Company.contacts'` |
| `'<- Type.field[]'` | Has-many relationship | `deals: '<- Deal.contact[]'` |
| `'A \| B \| C'` | Enum (pipe-separated) | `stage: 'Lead \| Qualified \| Customer'` |
| `'PascalCase'` | Custom verb | `qualify: 'Qualified'` |
| `null` | Opt out of CRUD verb | `update: null` (makes immutable) |
